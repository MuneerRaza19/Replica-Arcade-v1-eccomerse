Finally, this Privacy Policy explains your options regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. By visiting the Site directly or through another site, you accept the practices described in this Policy.
                    Data protection is a matter of trust, and your privacy is important to us. We shall therefore only use your name and other information which relates to you in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. We will only collect information where we must do so, and we will only collect information if it is relevant to our dealings with you.
                    We will only keep your information for as long as we are either required to by law or as is relevant for the purposes for which it was collected.

Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. You are responsible for protecting against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.
                    4. Your rights
